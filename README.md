Woopsi
======

Woopsi is a GUI framework for the Nintendo DS, written in C++.  The aim of the
project is to provide a windowing GUI that other programmers can use for their
applications, decreasing the tedious amount of custom code that they have to
write.

 - Complete API for constructing new gadgets:
   - Extensible font system that supports:
     - Compressed proportional and fixed-width fonts (monochrome and 16-bit);
     - FreeType library integration for TTF/OTF/etc fonts with antialiasing
       available in a separate distribution.
   - Text manipulation, including wrapping functions and width calculation;
   - Animation class with support for variable framerates and standard/pingpong
     looping;
   - Bitmap class for 16-bit bitmap image manipulation;
   - Graphics class providing clipped, DMA-accelerated drawing functions:
     - Pixels;
     - Lines;
     - Filled and unfilled rectangles;
     - Filled and unfilled ellipses;
     - XOR horizontal/vertical lines, pixels, rectangles and filled rectangles;
     - Bitmap blitting;
     - Bitmap blitting with transparent colour key;
     - Bitmap blitting in greyscale;
     - Flood fill;
     - Region scrolling;
     - Region copying;
     - Region dimming;
     - Region conversion to greyscale;
     - Text rendering.
   - Dynamic array container and iterator classes.
   - Date class.
 - Object-orientated design for easy integration into other C++ software;
 - Simple API for rapid GUI creation;
 - Non pre-emptive, FIFO multitasking - each gadget runs simultaneously;
 - Unicode strings encoded with UTF-8;
 - Two build options:
   - Standard libwoopsi.a library for use with DS projects;
   - SDL layer to facilitate native compilation on non-DS platforms and
     aid porting/debugging.
 - Suite of supporting Windows tools:
   - bmp2font, to convert BMPs to Woopsi fonts;
   - font2bmp, to convert Windows fonts to BMP images;
   - bmp2bmp, to convert BMPs to Woopsi bitmaps;
   - font2font, to convert Windows fonts to Woopsi fonts.


Requirements
------------

To run the project you will need either a DS emulator or a real DS and a flash
cart.  To compile the project you need [devKitPro][1] or [BlocksDS][2].

  [1]: http://devkitpro.org
  [2]: https://blocksds.github.io/docs/

You can install this library in BlocksDS with `wf-pacman` directly:

```bash
wf-pacman -Sy blocksds-libwoopsi
```

If you want to build the library from source, simply run this to build and
install the library in your BlocksDS environment:

```bash
make -j`nproc` install
```

SDL Compatibility
-----------------

Woopsi has been designed to be portable.  Thanks to this, Woopsi comes
equipped with an optional SDL layer that replaces libnds and allows the code
to be compiled for any platform with an SDL port.  To create an SDL build of
Woopsi:
  
 - Create a new SDL project in your dev environment of choice;
 - Copy the "libwoopsi" source folder into your SDL project;
 - Copy the contents of the "sdl" folder from this archive into your copy of
    the "libwoopsi/src" folder.
     
Note that you should not use the Woopsi makefiles, as these are only relevant
to DS builds of Woopsi.
